# Website Project  

---

Having a website like this for independent salons will give them an easy way to track personal information for clients. Being in the COVID-19 climate having personal information to track who has been in your salon as well as means to contact them if an out-break happens is almost a most today. But the focus of this website would allow the administrator to confirm or deny client appointments for different salon services like haircuts, color, etc. The website will always a client to make a temporary account to input information like full name, phone number, services requested, date and time for services. An administrator will be able to archive client data, so they have a record of who has been there for what service as well as allow the admin to adjust times of appointments and list prices for services.
